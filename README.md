# MonoGame_SandboxTest
This is a little project to work on some game UI exploration in my free time. Nothing in here is that crazy or new, but it's a fun exploration.

## Components

### CardRenderSystem
A small-scale system to set up and render cards like you'd see in Hearthstone or Marvel Snap.

### Options
A simple options system, currently scoped to just being a way to adjust screen size as needed by users.
